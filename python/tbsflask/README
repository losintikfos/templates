Twitter Bootstrap on Flask
============================================

This template is a very minimal Flask application supporting the Twitter bootstrap web framework.

Things to remember before using this template are:

   - Rehydrate the virtual environment with "pip install -r requirements.txt"
   - Rename the top level and inner application directories to your application's name
   - Change the namespace in runserver.py, __init__.py and views.py file to your application name

That's it!

Library versions used for this template are -

   Twitter bootstrap 3.0.0
   jQuery 1.10.2
